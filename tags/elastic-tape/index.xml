&lt;p&gt;As many users of the tape systems will know, we have recently experienced problems with the NLA, ET and JDMA services.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Update on JASMIN tape services and related issues</title><link>/ceda-div-test/news/updates/2023/2023-05-11-update-on-jasmin-tape-services-and-related-issues/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 May 2023 11:29:53 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ceda-div-test/news/updates/2023/2023-05-11-update-on-jasmin-tape-services-and-related-issues/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Please note the further updates below:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Although initially thought to be only a problem with ET/JDMA service itself, the current issues with slow throughput are now thought to be mainly due to a problem with the PFS storage from where the particular tape jobs are being ingested.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The issue with PFS storage is also affecting other volumes in that system, including XFC volumes &lt;code&gt;/work/xfc/*&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;/work/scratch-pw*&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;/gws/pw/j07/*&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;These issues are being actively pursued with the storage vendor and the urgency has been escalated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Further interventions to restore stability to the tape services are possible in due course.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We apologise for the disruption caused by these issues, but are working to understand and resolve them as soon as possible.JASMIN Team.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>The Near-line archive is now available.
