&lt;p&gt;We are making good progress with recovering data back into the Archive and have made significant progress. Over 1.6 Petabytes of data have been recovered to a holding area - 1.3 Petabytes of this has now been moved to its correct location in the Archive. Most of this should now be available to users - we are doing some final checks for data permissions.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Archive Incident - List of impacted data directories</title><link>/ceda-div-test/news/updates/2025/2025-11-28-incident-data-list/</link><pubDate>Fri, 28 Nov 2025 12:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ceda-div-test/news/updates/2025/2025-11-28-incident-data-list/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Dear users,

&lt;p&gt;Dear JASMIN and CEDA users,
we have an update on the CEDA Archive incident that occured on Tuesday the 18th of November. Some common questions are answered below including how to request which data you&amp;rsquo;d like to be a priority for recovery.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CEDA ARCHIVE INCIDENT - 18th November 2025</title><link>/ceda-div-test/news/updates/2025/2025-11-19-archive-incident/</link><pubDate>Wed, 19 Nov 2025 16:30:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ceda-div-test/news/updates/2025/2025-11-19-archive-incident/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Dear JASMIN and CEDA users,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At approximately 10:02 on 18th November 2025, during the migration of data in the CEDA archive, a mistake was made which resulted in some data being deleted from the archive. The issue was identified at approximately 12:07, the archive was locked down preventing further loss by approximately 12:25, and the incident was fully diagnosed by 14:00.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
