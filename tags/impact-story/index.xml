The UK is surrounded by important populations of seabirds, including Arctic Tern, Kittiwake, and Puffin, that play a key role as top predators and indicators of the health of marine ecosystems. Like many animals, seabirds are exposed to climate change in both marine and terrestrial environments, but the combined effects are rarely considered. Climate change impacts seabird species through a number of mechanisms; for example, by shifting the distributions of prey species, influencing storminess which affects mortality rates, causing overheating at the nest site, or increasing sea level and reducing available breeding habitat.

The Southern Ocean absorbs more heat than any other ocean and as a consequence of climate change, it is warming at an alarming rate. Warming oceans lead to a decline in Antarctic sea ice, increased ocean freshening, sea-level rise, reduced oxygen and CO2 uptake and slow the vertical exchange of waters. This may bring about increased food scarcity, diseases, extreme weather events, loss of coastal protection, and more. It is therefore extremely important to have a detailed understanding of what could happen in the future with a Southern Ocean that is warmer, less salty and is circulating in different ways.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>JASMIN helps track the impact of climate change on UK birds</title><link>/ceda-div-test/news/updates/2021/2021-01-28-jasmin-helps-track-the-impact-of-climate-change-on-uk-birds/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Jan 2021 09:32:31 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ceda-div-test/news/updates/2021/2021-01-28-jasmin-helps-track-the-impact-of-climate-change-on-uk-birds/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Over 600 different species of birds have been recorded in the UK to date[1] .

The UK’s top 10 warmest years have all occurred since 2002, and July 2019 saw the UK’s hottest ever recorded temperature (38.7 °C). Whilst many are enjoying the unusually non-rainy British weather, it doesn’t come without costs. Extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and flash flooding, are expected to increase in severity and frequency as our climate continues to change. Extreme weather can adversely affect the way we live our lives. Loss of food production, damaging wildlife habitats, and endangering human life are just a few impacts associated with climate change. Predicting global climate change is complex and requires vast amounts of data processing capabilities. Steps must be taken to improve the accuracy of future climate models. That’s where JASMIN - a data intensive supercomputer - comes in. &lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Using JASMIN for the largest ever UK wildlife assessment</title><link>/ceda-div-test/news/updates/2019/2019-10-31-using-jasmin-for-the-largest-ever-uk-wildlife-assessment/</link><pubDate>Thu, 31 Oct 2019 16:24:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>/ceda-div-test/news/updates/2019/2019-10-31-using-jasmin-for-the-largest-ever-uk-wildlife-assessment/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote class="blockquote"&gt;

Imagine trying to measure trends across thousands of different species and millions of datapoints, with biases in the data thrown in for added complexity… but that’s exactly what scientists have now done. The most comprehensive SoN report has now been completed with the help of JASMIN - our globally unique petascale analysis facility for data-intensive environmental science. Researchers relying on JASMIN for their data analysis contributed information to the SoN report, including several wildlife groups that had previously been impossible to analyse.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
