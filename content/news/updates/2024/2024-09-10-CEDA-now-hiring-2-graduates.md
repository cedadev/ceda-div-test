### About CEDA

The Centre for Environmental Data Analysis holds climate and environmental data and provide services to support UK scientists. We also run and maintain JASMIN, the UK’s high-performance data analysis facility for environmental science, an important national asset hosted by JASMIN is the CEDA Archive, a carefully-managed collection of over 25 Petabytes of environmental datasets going back over 20 years and covering everything from computer simulations of future climate to the latest satellite observations of the Earth.

CEDA (the Centre for Environmental Data Analysis) is a Division of RAL Space Department at the STFC Rutherford Appleton Laboratory. The CEDA team works collaboratively in a friendly and supportive team-working environment. Located at RAL, you would be on site among a range of fascinating and world-class facilities with passionate staff and graduates only too happy to tell you about their work, not to mention the wider Harwell Campus buzzing with innovation.

#### Graduate Environmental Data Scientist

At CEDA, you will join a team providing environmental data and associated services to the UK academic community. Scientists in our user community need access to large and up-to-date datasets which they can process, analyse and combine with other data on our infrastructure. They also deposit their own datasets in our archives for longterm preservation and dissemination to other users.

You will act as an Assistant Data Scientist. Your primary responsibilities will be in the data management of diverse earth observation and climate datasets to support NERC funded environmental science. New data will be sourced from external data providers as well as products derived from NERC funded science. You will also help to ensure that we hold local copies of a number of key Earth observation and climate datasets required by our science users, and support scientists who wish to archive their datasets with CEDA. Some of your responsilibities will include:

- Liaise with data suppliers and data users as necessary

- Coordinate and timetable data acquisition activities, including automated ingestion and quality checks on new data arrivals

- Describe and document new data products and the activities and instruments that produce them

- Establish and document format and version details

- Present activities and progress at relevant UK and European science meetings
